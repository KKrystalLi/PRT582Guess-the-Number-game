# PRT582 Guess-the-Number-game

## Introduction:
It is  a guess-the-number-game 
using Test Driven Development in Python.
At the same time, we use unittest as automated testing tools to test the code.

## Game rules
Players need to guess a four-digit randomly generated number. 
The program will then give some clues about the number. 
Once the player has guessed the number correctly, the program displays the number of attempts.
